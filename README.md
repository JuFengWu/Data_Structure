In sort folder, it demostrates two sort, one is merge sort, other is heap sort.

In sort.h , you can undefine "CPP17CODE" to switch to cpp 17.
But current Google Test does not support cpp17, there will be some errors when building test projects.

In project "SortTest", I use google test to test the function. 
You can click "test->run->all test" to run the test function.
